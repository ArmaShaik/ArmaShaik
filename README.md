### 👋 Hi, I’m Arma

![Arma Shaik](./Arma_photo.jpg)

Data-driven analyst with 5+ years of experience translating business challenges into actionable insights. I bring a unique blend of credit risk, analytics, and digital strategy — with hands-on expertise in Python, SQL, Tableau, Snowflake, AWS, and UiPath.

I’ve led credit and risk portfolios at Union Bank of India, supported digital transformation through dashboarding and automation, and contributed to an 80.05% YoY profit growth during a large-scale merger.

Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at the Wisconsin School of Business, applying my skills across machine learning, optimization, RPA, and cloud-native solutions.
